## Description of the project
This project is the game Towers of Hanoi. Tell the computer to move numbers from row to row until you have all 4 numbers on the last row, in descending order. Do this without placing any larger numbers on top of any smaller numbers. 

I used a 2D list for the board. When the user enters the row, the program will find the spot to place it based on the index. The index will adjust according to how long the list is.

## What is the purpose


## How to use it
The way you use the program is by typing in the row you want to move a number out of, and then type in the number of the row that you want to place the number in.


## Defeciences the program has
One problem is that if you try to pull from an empty row, it will tell you the index is out of range.
Also if you enter a row number that it not 1,2, or 3, it will tell you that the index us out of range
